Welcome to my Major League Baseball Investigation for different styles of baseballs in nationally televised games.

Quickly, about the organization of this repository: 

For viewing my work, please address scrape_games.md to view the code used to wrangle the data. 

Then, please see significance_tests.md to view my code for analyzing if there was significance in the data (testing my driving question). 

One note on viewing significance_tests.Rmd: I am having trouble getting the graphs to fall in line so you will have to open the image files that are in the repository, sorry for any inconvenience.

If you would like to run the code yourself, datasets that I used and created throughout the process are the .csv files and you can download the .Rmd files to run code.

This project is far from complete but due to time limitations, this will have to do for now.
