Welcome to my Major League Baseball Investigation for different styles of baseballs in nationally televised games.

Quickly, about the organization of this repository. For viewing my work, please address scrape_games.md to view the code used to wrangle the data. Then, please see significance_tests.md to view my code for analyzing if there was significance in the data (testing my driving question).
If you would like to run the code yourself, datasets that I used and created throughout the process are the .csv files and you can download the .Rmd files to run code.
