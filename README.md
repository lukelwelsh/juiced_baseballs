Welcome to my Major League Baseball Investigation for different styles of baseballs in nationally televised games.

Quickly, about the organization of this repository: 

For viewing my work, please address [scrape_games.md](https://github.com/lukelwelsh/juiced_baseballs/blob/main/scrape_games.md) to view the code used to wrangle the data. 

Then, please see [significance_tests.pdf](https://github.com/lukelwelsh/juiced_baseballs/blob/main/significance_tests.pdf) to see my analysis if there was significance in the data (testing my driving question).
 - the graphs were not loading in with a normal markdown, so I switched to using .pdf instead
